DISCO:
ArrayList has a method called iterator, in the documentation it says that it returns "an iterator over the elements in this list". We don't know what this means, 
and it does not have a useful toString method (it just returns memory location). 

It felt weird using ArrayList because we didn't have access to any of the attributes and could only use accessor methods, unlike when we wrote it ourselves

OrderedArrayList having an ArrayList as its underlying data type was very useful. It allowed our toString method to be much more simple - just returning _data.toString()
Additionally, we no longer had to use int _size to store the number of meaningful values, as ArrayLists only store meaningful values.
Ex:
int[2] -> [0,0] whereas ArrayList<Integer>(2) -> []

We ran into trouble with addLinear where we had a for loop that looped _data.size() times. The problem was that when soemthing inevitably was added to _data
_data.size() was increased, creating an infinite loop.

QCC:
Is there a built in java class or one that we can import that fucntions as the OrderedArrayList we built?
